  <li>Median Income - Our infographic will present a chloropleth district map based on Median Household Income per postal code.
  This number divides the postal population into two equal groups: half having an income above that amount, and half having an income below that amount.
We chose this specific economic aggregate for our data because we feel that it well represents the most average individual within
that district.</li>
  <li>Chloropleth - The type of map we will be using, a thematic map which colors pre-defined areas in proportion
  to a statisical variable, which in this case may be Median Income.</li>
  <li>Z-score - this value is a standardization score for each neighbourhood which shows by how much they deviate from the
  parameter, which in this case is the overall NYC statistics. This number is very important, because it can put into perspective
the statistical variance of each neighborhood from NYC as a whole.</li>
</ul></p>

<p> All our data is from the CCC (Citizens' Commitee for Children) of New York</p>
<h2>Variables to Consider</h2>
<p><ul>
  <li>Median Household Income</li>
  <li>Avg NYC Income</li>
  <li>Covid-19 Infection Proportion</li>
  <li>Crime Proportion (per thousand)</li>
  <li>Educational Proficiency (via standardized HS tests)</li>
  <li>Life Expectancy</li>
  <li>Unemployment Rate</li>
  <li>Commute Distribution</li>

  <li>Homelessness Proportion(per thousand)</li>

<h2>MacroSummary from Austin:</h2>
<img id = "MacroAustin" src = "images/IMG_5076.jpg">
<p>Austin's macrosummary includes strong signifiers in terms of ways in which
  different sets of data can be related. This differs from mine in the sense that I had
  settled on representing all data in the microsummary and simply a chloropleth of
  median income within the macrosummary. I like Austin's approach because the signifiers
  allow users to visibly and consistently see the possible interconnectedness of
  the various data we will analyze. This visualization will also allow us to greater communicate
our goal of the socioeconomic inequity and the impacts of this inequity throughout New York. In terms
of usability we can implement more quality-of-life changes into this macro summary such as a zoom button,
a useful signiifer, and perhaps a scale, increasing understandability. The achievability of this simply relies
on us being able to generalize generating chlorpleth for the data. Furthermore, we must make sure all the data
we plan to use is processed correctly.
</p>
<h2>MicroSummary from Austin:</h2>
<img id = "MicroAustin" src = "images/IMG_5077.jpg">
<p>In terms of achievability, the by-year feature may be impossible to implement for all data-points due to
  the inconsistency of data formats we downloaded from the CCC, and thus would be ill-favored from the perspective
  of consistency. The addition of "At a Glance" helps readers from reducing these neighbourhoods
  to bare statistics, giving us greater cultural context. Perhaps we could somehow generate links for more
  information regarding these districts. The discoverability of other microsummaries from this macrosummary page is limited
  due to the size of the macrosummary, perhaps the macrosummary in the upper left could be a bit larger, or bolded.
</p>
<h2>Macro+MicroSummary from Tahmid:</h2>
<img id = "Tahmid" src = "images/IMG_5075.jpg">
<p>Tahmid's Macrosummary does a good job of incorportating the understandability
  design principles. I think the model is accurate and understandable, and
  although the elements are all visible from a static standpoint, I think it could
  be improved by making it more clear that each area in the map links to a microview.<br>
  This macrosummary is also used easily and comfortable. There is a strong mapping
  from the data to the chart, and the affordances have clear constraints.</p>
  <br>
<p>Tahmid's Microsummary also is fairly understandable, though undoubtably small.
This different model still makes it clear which neighborhood is being discussed,
and all the data is clearly presented below(in the webpage version, the data will go
alongside the headers).It could use some more affordances, such as linking it back
to the main page, and could also be expanded to be more comfortably used and
interpreted. It does lend itself to being easily evolved though, and provides a
strong framework for future renditions of the page.</p>

<h2>Division of Labor:</h2>
<p>Austin will handle the generation of the different pages and formulating the data
  for use in different micropages.<br> Tahmid will handle the design of the page
